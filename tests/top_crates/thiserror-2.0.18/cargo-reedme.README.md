This library provides a convenient derive macro for the standard library’s
[`std::error::Error`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/core/error/trait.Error.html) trait.

<br>

# Example

```rust
use thiserror::Error;

#[derive(Error, Debug)]
pub enum DataStoreError {
    #[error("data store disconnected")]
    Disconnect(#[from] io::Error),
    #[error("the data for key `{0}` is not available")]
    Redaction(String),
    #[error("invalid header (expected {expected:?}, found {found:?})")]
    InvalidHeader {
        expected: String,
        found: String,
    },
    #[error("unknown data store error")]
    Unknown,
}
```

<br>

# Details

- Thiserror deliberately does not appear in your public API. You get the
  same thing as if you had written an implementation of
  [`std::error::Error`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/core/error/trait.Error.html) by hand, and switching from handwritten impls to
  thiserror or vice versa is not a breaking change.

- Errors may be enums, structs with named fields, tuple structs, or unit
  structs.

- A [`Display`] impl is generated for your error if you provide
  `#[error("...")]` messages on the struct or each variant of your enum, as
  shown above in the example.

  The messages support a shorthand for interpolating fields from the error.

    - `#[error("{var}")]` ⟶ `write!("{}", self.var)`
    - `#[error("{0}")]` ⟶ `write!("{}", self.0)`
    - `#[error("{var:?}")]` ⟶ `write!("{:?}", self.var)`
    - `#[error("{0:?}")]` ⟶ `write!("{:?}", self.0)`

  These shorthands can be used together with any additional format args,
  which may be arbitrary expressions. For example:

  ```rust
  #[derive(Error, Debug)]
  pub enum Error {
      #[error("invalid rdo_lookahead_frames {0} (expected < {max})", max = i32::MAX)]
      InvalidLookahead(u32),
  }
```

  If one of the additional expression arguments needs to refer to a field of
  the struct or enum, then refer to named fields as `.var` and tuple fields
  as `.0`.

  ```rust
  #[derive(Error, Debug)]
  pub enum Error {
      #[error("first letter must be lowercase but was {:?}", first_char(.0))]
      WrongCase(String),
      #[error("invalid index {idx}, expected at least {} and at most {}", .limits.lo, .limits.hi)]
      OutOfBounds { idx: usize, limits: Limits },
  }
```

- A [`From`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/core/convert/trait.From.html) impl is generated for each variant that contains a `#[from]`
  attribute.

  The variant using `#[from]` must not contain any other fields beyond the
  source error (and possibly a backtrace — see below). Usually
  `#[from]` fields are unnamed, but `#[from]` is allowed on a named field
  too.

  ```rust
  #[derive(Error, Debug)]
  pub enum MyError {
      Io(#[from] io::Error),
      Glob(#[from] globset::Error),
  }
```

- The Error trait's [`source()`] method is implemented to return whichever
  field has a `#[source]` attribute or is named `source`, if any. This is
  for identifying the underlying lower level error that caused your error.

  The `#[from]` attribute always implies that the same field is `#[source]`,
  so you don't ever need to specify both attributes.

  Any error type that implements `std::error::Error` or dereferences to `dyn
  std::error::Error` will work as a source.

  ```rust
  #[derive(Error, Debug)]
  pub struct MyError {
      msg: String,
      #[source]  // optional if field name is `source`
      source: anyhow::Error,
  }
```

- The Error trait’s [`provide()`] method is implemented to provide whichever
  field has a type named `Backtrace`, if any, as a
  [`std::backtrace::Backtrace`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/backtrace/struct.Backtrace.html). Using `Backtrace` in errors requires a
  nightly compiler with Rust version 1.73 or newer.

  ```rust
  use std::backtrace::Backtrace;

  #[derive(Error, Debug)]
  pub struct MyError {
      msg: String,
      backtrace: Backtrace,  // automatically detected
  }
```

- If a field is both a source (named `source`, or has `#[source]` or
  `#[from]` attribute) *and* is marked `#[backtrace]`, then the Error
  trait's [`provide()`] method is forwarded to the source's `provide` so
  that both layers of the error share the same backtrace. The `#[backtrace]`
  attribute requires a nightly compiler with Rust version 1.73 or newer.

  ```rust
  #[derive(Error, Debug)]
  pub enum MyError {
      Io {
          #[backtrace]
          source: io::Error,
      },
  }
```

- For variants that use `#[from]` and also contain a `Backtrace` field, a
  backtrace is captured from within the `From` impl.

  ```rust
  #[derive(Error, Debug)]
  pub enum MyError {
      Io {
          #[from]
          source: io::Error,
          backtrace: Backtrace,
      },
  }
```

- Errors may use `error(transparent)` to forward the source and [`Display`]
  methods straight through to an underlying error without adding an
  additional message. This would be appropriate for enums that need an
  "anything else" variant.

  ```rust
  #[derive(Error, Debug)]
  pub enum MyError {
      ...

      #[error(transparent)]
      Other(#[from] anyhow::Error),  // source and Display delegate to anyhow::Error
  }
```

  Another use case is hiding implementation details of an error
  representation behind an opaque error type, so that the representation is
  able to evolve without breaking the crate’s public API.

  ```rust
  // PublicError is public, but opaque and easy to keep compatible.
  #[derive(Error, Debug)]
  #[error(transparent)]
  pub struct PublicError(#[from] ErrorRepr);

  impl PublicError {
      // Accessors for anything we do want to expose publicly.
  }

  // Private and free to change across minor version of the crate.
  #[derive(Error, Debug)]
  enum ErrorRepr {
      ...
  }
```

- See also the [`anyhow`] library for a convenient single error type to use
  in application code.
